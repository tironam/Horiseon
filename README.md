In the HTML, I was able to change a lot of the div assets to semantics to make the different sections easier to read. I was also able to clean up some of the HTML to make it more consistent. For example, some of the img tags towards the bottom had different end tags. I also added alt attributes to the end of all the images and changed the title of the site to make it more accessible. I initially had a lot of trouble changing the classes in HTML and applying those classes to the CSS to reduce some of the clutter there, but I tried it again later and was able to get it work properly.
